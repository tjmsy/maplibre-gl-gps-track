## TODO:
- Warp to the GPS position when loading a GPS track.
- Visualize heart rates or slopes in combination with speed, using line-width interpolation or potentially other properties  (ideas to be explored).
- Implement support for additional file formats (e.g., KML, GeoJSON, TCX) besides GPX.
- Implement animation for visualizing the movement of the GPS track.
- Refine code style and improve readability.
- Implement additional features.
- Enhance UI.

## Current Status:
This project is currently on hold as Iâ€™m focusing on other development tasks. However, I welcome contributions! If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. 

Thank you for your interest and support!
